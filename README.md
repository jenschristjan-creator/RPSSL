This project is a small game called Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard.
It is played between the player and the computer. The player types one of the five choices: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, or Lizard.
The computer also makes a random choice, the program then comparess both choices and decides who wins the round. Each win gives a point.
The first to reach 3 points wins the whole game. It is a fun way to practice loops, conditions, random numbers, and string comparison.
